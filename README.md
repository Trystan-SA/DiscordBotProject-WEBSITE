# Discord Bot - Website
 Personal Project - A Discord Web app that can configure a Discord bot. Work together with the DiscordBot app. 
 
 This project was made under 4 months. The webapp have a full Client Authentication process. Once signed-in, the client invite the Discord Bot in his server. And then can be configured from the Web Dashboard. 
 
 The website also have a simple blog system (made in 1 week, nothing really fancy). And a little prototype of a feedback app.
 
 
 This project will not work out of nothing from a git clone. It is broken since the code won't generate a Mysql database configuration from itself. I just share the source if someone want to have an eye into it. 
 
Please note that this project was my first time doing a SaaS app, I never used Nodejs before that and barely knew Javascript.
